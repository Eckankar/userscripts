userscripts
===========

A collection of my user scripts. These scripts act on websites to improve certain small things.

## Prerequisites: 

* Firefox users need to install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
* Chrome users need to install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)

## Script installation:

* Go to a script, and click the "Raw" button in the top right corner. An installation prompt should then pop up.

You can also go to [my Greasyfork page](https://greasyfork.org/users/4769-eckankar) and install them from there.
